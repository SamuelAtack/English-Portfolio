This artwork serves as a representation of my identity and the ongoing developments in my life. The house acts as a metaphor for me, with each component symbolising different aspects of my identity, values, and life. The house itself signifies my life, encompassing and uniting these various facets. The windows provide insight into specific elements of who I am. The top-left window represents my education. The presence of debate within this window is because of my interest in discussing ideas and challenging perspectives, an essential part of my thought process and how I engage with others. The top-right window reflects my family and faith. It depicts my parents, siblings, and myself, showing the central role my family plays in shaping my identity. My Christian faith is also represented here, symbolising the values and beliefs that guide me in decision-making and provide a sense of purpose. Together, these aspects give me a profound sense of belonging. The bottom-left window is dedicated to my friendships. They are an integral part of my life, offering support, joy, and shared experiences that contribute to my personal development. This window serves as a reminder of their significance. The bottom-right window represents a significant decision I have been contemplating: a choice between two distinct paths. One path, symbolised by a boat, represents the possibility of pursuing a non-traditional career, such as working for an NGO like Sea Shepherd, and making a tangible impact on the world. The other path, represented by a more conventional building, reflects the allure of a stable, traditional lifestyle such as research or more corporate jobs. This window represents my struggle to reconcile my values with my future aspirations. At the centre of the house are the doors, symbolising my bicultural identity. One door bears the Union Jack, reflecting my English heritage, while the other displays the Tricolore Fran√ßais, representing my life in France. These two cultures have profoundly shaped my worldview. Surrounding the house are ladders on both sides, representing my ascent towards the future. However, their destination is marked by a large question mark in the sun, symbolising the uncertainty of my path. This ambiguity reflects both the potential and the hope inherent in not yet knowing where I am headed. Inside the house, a clock with question marks instead of hands further illustrates my ongoing quest to understand how to utilise my time best and determine the direction of my life. Finally, the rain and sun above the house represent the ever-changing nature of my thoughts and emotions. This serves as a reminder that I am still in a process of growth and self-discovery and that it is acceptable not to have all the answers at this stage.
