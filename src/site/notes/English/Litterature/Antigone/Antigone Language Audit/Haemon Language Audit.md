**One Sentence**
In his speech, Haemon is revealed as not only a young-man, caught up in the romance of youth; but also a capable indivdual, who uses his emotional intelligence to his advantage. First acknowlwedging Creon's authority, as he knows it is the only way to reach his father. Then showing him that people would respect him for changing his opinion, as to make sure his excessive ego is not destroyed by a lack of public approval. And finally, letting his radiant feelings shine through and passing from grief to anger against Creon's unmoving stubornes.
