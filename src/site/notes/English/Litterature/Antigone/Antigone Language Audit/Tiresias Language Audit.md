In Antigone, Tiresias is the voice of divine will and order. Booming language that is rich in metaphor, prophetic menace, and unrelenting moral certainty. Across the two selected passages, his rhetoric reveals a character whose power lies not in political control but in a terrifying clarity of vision. Through Tiresias, Sophocles probes the global issue of human transgression against divine order, exposing the dangers of hubristic leadership, as clearly present in the character of Creon.

In the first passage, Tiresias’s diction is deliberately cryptic and visceral. He begins by recalling how he listened to “the singing and the secret language of the birds,” casting himself immediately as a mediator between the human and the divine. The phrase “secret language” signals both esoteric knowledge (only understandable to certain people) and grounds the priest’s ethos. Yet this language is replaced by “hysterical twittering and whistling,” a cacophony that evokes chaos and disorder, which are common signs of divine displeasure. This is reinforced with grotesque imagery: “bloodstained beaks,” “spurting stinking acid,” “clogged with fat and decay.” These bodily images turn the sacred ritual of divination into a scene of corruption, suggesting that Creon’s actions have so polluted Thebes that even the gods recoil. Tiresias does not accuse directly. Instead, he allows the foreboding signs and his past accuracy in the matter of prediction to do all the talking for him. 

The rhetorical mode is different in the second extract, it changes to one of unflinching confrontation. The tone becomes accusatory and unambiguous: “You will have made your payment, corpse for corpse, with a child of your own blood.” This threat, framed with judicial precision, similar to that which Creon is using against his own niece, signals Tiresias’s prosecuting role. His language is filled with threats of retribution: “The suffering / You inflicted upon others, will be inflicted / Upon you.” This is as unambiguous as ever; one’s actions echo back upon oneself. The imagery of the Furies, “who rise up / From Hell and swoop down from Heaven,” amplifies the inevitability of Creon’s downfall, invoking mythological figures that personify vengeance itself. Tiresias, though blind, sees far more than Creon does.

Metaphor and irony pervade Tiresias’s speech. His declaration “Have I been bribed, do you think?” is rhetorical, meant to pre-empt Creon’s scepticism. Through his speech, Sophocles elevates Tiresias beyond the realm of character into that of moral arbiter. He speaks for forces larger than politics, larger than both himself and Creon, forces that Creon, in his hubris, believes he can ignore.

**One sentence:**
Tiresias' unrelenting, soul piercieng diction reveals his role as an unforgiving executioner. He comes down with a visceral tone, spewing truth from that which lies above, and when Creon, in his hubris, dares question the authority which is bestowed upon him, he is not pleased. His rhetorical mode shifts from one of warning, to unbreakable confrontation. He is accusatory, and unambigous. As a whole, unavoidable as death itself. Death which is inflicted upon those who inflict it upon others, and bestowed unforgivingly, as Tiresias knows his authority is delivered by the highest possible.
