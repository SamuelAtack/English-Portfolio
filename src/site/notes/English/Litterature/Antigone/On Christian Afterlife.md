- **burial rites**
    
    - limited instructions
        
    - Burial is most common, especially on Church grounds
        
    - Just a tradition, no explicit instructions in the Bible
        
- **afterlife**
    
    - Beliefs about heaven/hell vary a lot by denomination
        
    - Heaven
        
        - There is textual evidence that heaven is meant to come down to earth
            
            - So the objective of Christianity is to make the Earth a perfect place
                
            - "Revelation 21:1–3"
                
            - " Matthew 6:10 (The Lord’s Prayer)"
                
            - "Genesis 1:31"
                
        - Other beliefs include:
            
            - a more classical approach with things such as a city in some other place
                
            - just a space in between spaces
                
    - Hell
        
        - Some believe there is no such thing, and that everyone will go to heaven (minority belief)
            
        - The most common belief is that it is a place where God is not present, and as God is the root of all things good, it is a terrible place
            
    - The body
        
        - Jesus talks about reincarnation into a new body and a new form
            
        - This new body would be perfect, people would be "reborn" and live forever
            
- **Going to the afterlife**
    
    - One has to be truly sorry for one's sins to go to heaven
        
    - Beliefs vary on whether it can happen posthumously
        
    - Those who are the poorest materially on earth will be the richest (not materially) in heaven
        
        - "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven" (Matthew 5:3)
