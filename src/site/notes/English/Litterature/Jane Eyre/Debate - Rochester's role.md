### Rochester’s Role in Jane’s Development

#### FOR the Statement: Rochester as a Positive Influence

1. Encouragement of Jane’s Wit and Confidence  
      
    

- Rochester’s conversations with Jane are intellectually stimulating and challenge her to think critically. For example, in Chapter 14, he appreciates her candour, saying:  
    "You examine me, Miss Eyre... Do you think me handsome?"  
    This exchange demonstrates Rochester’s comfort with Jane expressing her honest thoughts, fostering her self-assurance.
    
- Jane’s quick wit and boldness grow as she feels valued in their exchanges. Rochester treats her as an intellectual equal rather than a subordinate.
    

3. Support for Jane’s Independence  
      
    

- Rochester acknowledges Jane’s unique qualities and independence, as seen when he comments on her strong moral compass and self-respect.
    

- He explicitly recognises her as different from others around him, praising her integrity.
    

5. Challenging Jane’s Conventionality  
      
    

- Rochester introduces Jane to more complex, morally ambiguous situations, helping her develop a nuanced understanding of human behaviour and relationships.
    
- By exposing her to a world beyond Lowood, he helps her move towards her self-realisation and individuality.

#### AGAINST the Statement: Rochester as a Negative Influence

1. Manipulation and Secrecy  
      
    

- Rochester deliberately manipulates Jane’s emotions, particularly in his interactions with Blanche Ingram. His pretence of courting Blanche is a calculated move to provoke Jane’s feelings, undermining her emotional stability.
    
- His withholding of critical truths, such as the existence of his wife Bertha, demonstrates a lack of trust and transparency, which impacts Jane’s growth negatively. His secrecy puts Jane in a morally compromised position without her knowledge.
    

3. Power Imbalance  
      
    

- Rochester’s wealth, status, and age create an unequal dynamic in their relationship, which he exploits to control and test Jane.
    

- For instance, his disguised appearance as a gypsy in Chapter 15 is a direct manipulation to gauge Jane’s feelings under false pretences. This undermines the respect and honesty needed for her to grow.
    

5. Emotional Dependence  
      
    

- Rochester fosters emotional dependence in Jane by making her the sole confidante of his burdens while offering her no clear path for her own independence.
    
- His intensity and passion can overwhelm Jane, potentially stifling her ability to act autonomously.
