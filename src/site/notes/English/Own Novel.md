- title

- narrative perspective
	- all-knowing narrator, third person, only describe the protagonist with "he"
		- third person narrator places the focus of the reader not so much on the characters themselves, but on the events which occur, which makes the reader think
- structure
	- split the book based on the stages of life, as a youth the narrator encounters the children and lovers, as an adult he sees those who despise the tree, those who curse it. Then, finally, at retirement he sees how drastically different the lives of those people. Those who appreciate and enjoy nature get blessed themselves, and the opposite. 
	- chronological progression through decades
- setting
	- residential district, narrow street
		- fixed settign as a narrative anchor, we can change the people and time, but the location stays constant
- character development
    - The protagonist (referred to only as “he”) matures not through dramatic action, but through stillness and observation.
    - Early on, he is passive and curious, a boy who notices but doesn’t interpret. In adulthood, he begins judging: frustrated by those who cut branches, pave over roots. Eventually, he stops judging, and instead understands.        
- Use of motifs
    - Tree as life’s axis: The tree reflects changing values, seasons, beliefs
    - Engraved initials fade with time, representing truth impermanence.
    - Birdsong and falling leaves as cyclical motif
    - Shadows cast by the tree grow longer with each chapter: literal and symbolic lengthening of time.
- Genre
    - Fiction
    - philosophical novel of observation
- Language style
    - lyrical descriptions.        
    - Dialogue sparse or non-existent
    - Long sentences branch like roots (also because I write long sentences)
