 **###  Introduction (1 minute)

Good afternoon. Today, I’ll be exploring how social class and economic status influence relationships by dictating power dynamics, access to resources, and societal perceptions. The global issue I am examining looks at how class structures affect personal connections, shaping both individual agency and interactions between people, across different time periods and cultures.

The theme of class disparities in relationships has long been an important subject of discussion. In our society today, we continue to see how wealth and social standing influence who we associate with, how we are treated, and even how we view ourselves. It’s clear that our interactions are often not purely based on personal feelings, but are impacted by external factors such as power dynamics, access to education, and financial stability.

To explore this further, I will analyse how social class shapes relationships in two works: Charlotte Brontë’s Jane Eyre, a 19th-century novel that focuses on the complex relationship between the orphaned Jane and the wealthy, mysterious Mr. Rochester, and Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite, a contemporary South Korean film that dissects the exploitation and fragility of relationships across socioeconomic divides. Both works offer strikingly different perspectives, but they share a common thread: they expose how social class influences emotional connections, often creating barriers, tensions, and power struggles.

### Zoom In on Jane Eyre (2 minutes)

Let’s begin by analysing a key moment in Jane Eyre: the garden proposal scene from Volume 2, Chapter 14. This scene is pivotal in the novel, where Rochester confesses his love for Jane, yet their conversation remains deeply influenced by the class dynamics and power imbalances between them. The moment they share is tender but also filled with tension, demonstrating how even love cannot escape the constraints of their differing social positions.

One of the most powerful moments in tis scene occurs when Jane asserts her equality, saying: “Do you think because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am soulless and heartless?” These words are not merely a response to Rochester’s condescending attitude, but a challenge to the classist structures of Victorian society that defined worth based on appearance, wealth, and status. Jane boldly demands to be recognised for her inner strength and intelligence, emphasising that social standing should not dictate one’s value. Her defiance speaks to a broader, universal struggle against social inequality, asserting that she has just as much soul and heart as any privileged individual. She goes on to say, “I am not talking to you now through the medium of custom, conventionalities, nor even of mortal flesh:—it is my spirit that addresses your spirit; just as if both had passed through the grave, and we stood at God’s feet, equal,—as we are!" This declaration is significant because it frames their relationship as one that transcends physical and social barriers, positioning their spirits as equals despite the material circumstances.

Rochester’s response, though full of love, still reveals his struggle with class hierarchies. His tone, though affectionate, reflects an underlying belief that their relationship, while breaking societal norms, is still shaped by his superior status. He acknowledges Jane’s spirit, but his response, “I swear it—and the oath shall be kept,” demonstrates the power dynamics at play—he wishes to keep her, yet his possessiveness remains. Even in moments of tenderness, Rochester's language reflects his difficulty in seeing Jane as entirely independent of her lower class.

The symbolism of nature in this scene further reinforces the tension between them. The chestnut tree, split by lightning foreshadows the emotional and societal obstacles they will face, and mirrors the fragility of their bond. The tree’s split signifies the division between them, yet its potential for renewal also suggests that, despite the barriers of class, their relationship may still endure if they can overcome these struggles.

### Zoom Out on Jane Eyre (2 minutes)

When we zoom out and consider the broader context of Jane Eyre, we see that class dynamics influence not just Jane’s relationship with Rochester, but her interactions with almost everyone she encounters. Throughout the novel, Jane’s relationships are shaped and constrained by her social position, forcing her to navigate the difficult terrain between personal agency and societal expectations. The novel highlights how deeply entrenched class structures dictate how people are treated and how they perceive themselves and others.

In her early experiences at Gateshead, for instance, we see how the Reeds—her aunt and cousins—ostracise her not because of her character, but because of her lack of wealth and inheritance. As an orphan with no fortune, Jane is positioned as an outsider, inferior to her wealthier relatives. This lack of financial security not only affects Jane’s treatment but also shapes her sense of self-worth. Her mistreatment at Gateshead is a powerful critique of a society that values individuals primarily based on their social standing, and it sets the stage for Jane’s lifelong struggle against the social forces that seek to define her by her class rather than her personal qualities.

Finally, Jane’s reunion with Rochester at the novel’s end represents a moment of transformation, where social class no longer dominates their relationship. Now financially independent, Jane enters into the relationship with a newfound sense of equality. This shift is symbolic of the novel’s broader message: that genuine emotional connection can only be achieved when both parties stand on equal footing. Jane’s wealth, which she has earned through her own work, allows her to enter a relationship based on mutual respect and autonomy. The novel suggests that true love and connection cannot thrive in an atmosphere of inequality, but when power dynamics are balanced, relationships can flourish.

### Zoom In on Parasite (2 minutes)

Turning to Parasite, a film that explores the brutal realities of class divides through visual storytelling, the first still we will examine is the Kims descending into a hidden basement, symbolising both the literal and metaphorical stratification of class. The contrast between the affluent surface world and the dark, confined underground deepens the class divide and sparks the Kims’ realisation of their subjugation. The claustrophobic nature of the basement becomes a symbol of the underclass, buried both physically and socially, unseen by those above. This discovery stirs conflict not only between the Kims and the Parks but also within the lower classes as they compete for proximity to wealth.

Another pivotal still shows Mr. Park holding his nose as he approaches Mr. Kim. This moment symbolises their power dynamic, with Mr. Park’s disdain highlighting the deep emotional and social divide. The recurring motif of “smell” becomes a metaphor for class discrimination, where Mr. Park’s repulsion reflects an invisible social barrier defining who belongs and who is deemed inferior. This moment clarifies the emotional divide and fuels Mr. Kim’s growing resentment toward the Park family, contributing to the film’s eventual climax.

The climactic confrontation at the party, marked by chaotic framing, visually reveals the collapse of the facade of harmony. Mr. Kim’s violent outburst is the culmination of systemic humiliation and exploitation. The violence reflects how deeply ingrained class dynamics can fester, leading to explosive eruptions, and severing any illusion of coexistence between the classes.

The final still shows Da-hye and Ki-woo sharing a kiss in Da-hye’s room, a moment in stark contrast to the film’s austere settings. Da-hye’s privileged environment symbolises her sheltered upbringing, while Ki-woo’s calculated presence reflects his desire to bridge the divide. The kiss is a complex expression of both affection and ambition, as Ki-woo seeks to climb the social ladder, illustrating the intertwining of love, desire, and social manoeuvring in relationships shaped by class disparity.

### Zoom Out on Parasite (2 minutes)

When we zoom out and consider the overarching class dynamics in Parasite, we see how the Parks’ reliance on the Kims for labour creates a pseudo-familial relationship that is, at its core, transactional. The Parks may treat the Kims with some level of familiarity, but this familiarity is built on the Kims’ role as service providers rather than as equals. The Parks’ interactions with the Kims are shaped by their understanding that the Kims are subordinates, despite the superficial gestures of closeness. This reliance on the Kims’ labour reinforces the power imbalance, as the Parks' comfort and luxury are directly tied to the exploitation of the Kims and others in their social position.

Finally, Parasite explores the interplay of deception and aspiration as tools for class mobility. The Kims’ deception, driven by desperation, involves manipulating the Parks to secure employment and gain proximity to wealth, while the Parks' actions are characterised more by ignorance than deceit. Their obliviousness to the Kims’ true circumstances and the systemic inequalities that sustain their privilege reflects how wealth can insulate individuals from the struggles of others. This contrast highlights the complexities of social mobility, as the Kims’ attempts to rise above their impoverished status, symbolised by Ki-woo’s education and efforts to integrate into the Parks’ world, ultimately fail. The film suggests that structural inequality is inescapable—no matter how much the Kims aspire or scheme, the class divide remains insurmountable, leading to tragic and violent consequences. By exposing this harsh reality, Parasite underscores the systemic nature of class barriers and the futility of striving to overcome them in a world that perpetuates social stratification.

### Conclusion (1 minute)

To conclude, both Jane Eyre and Parasite offer profound insights into the impact of class on relationships, though their perspectives differ significantly. In Jane Eyre, class is a barrier that can be overcome through personal growth, the pursuit of equality, and financial independence. Jane’s eventual stability allows her to achieve a relationship with Rochester based on mutual respect and agency. Her transformation symbolises the possibility of transcending class limitations and forging genuine emotional connections. The novel suggests that while class shapes relationships, these boundaries can be overcome through individual agency and determination.

In contrast, Parasite depicts class disparity as deeply entrenched and inescapable. The film critiques systemic inequality, exposing how class divides are perpetuated through exploitation and lead to resentment, violence, and fractured relationships. The Kims’ and Parks’ interactions highlight deceit, manipulation, and the brutal consequences of class-based oppression. The film suggests that despite efforts to transcend poverty, structural barriers remain insurmountable, keeping the rich and poor separated.

Together, these works illustrate how class shapes, hinders, or prevents genuine connections, offering a powerful commentary on its enduring impact. They challenge us to reflect on how class divisions influence perceptions of worth, intimacy, and power—and whether these barriers can ever be dismantled.**
