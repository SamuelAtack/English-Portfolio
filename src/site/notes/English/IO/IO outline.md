#### Introduction 1 minute

- Global Issue: Social class and economic status influence relationships by dictating power dynamics, access to resources, and societal perceptions.

- Briefly introduce:
    

- Jane Eyre: 
    

- A 19th-century novel exploring love, independence, and class struggle through Jane's relationship with Rochester.
    

- Parasite:

- Visuals: Close-up shots focus on Mr. Park’s expression and Mr. Kim’s reaction, highlighting the emotional divide.
    
- Class Connection: The recurring motif of "smell" becomes a metaphor for class discrimination.
    
- Impact on Relationships: Mr. Park’s disdain solidifies Mr. Kim’s growing resentment, driving the climax of the film.
    

2. The secret basement’s discovery, representing the literal and metaphorical stratification of class.

![Pasted image 20250320113713.png](/img/user/Media/Pasted%20image%2020250320113713.png)
    
- Visuals: The camera follows the Kims as they descend into the dark, confined space of the bunker.
    
- Class Connection: The bunker serves as a powerful symbol of the hidden underclass, living out of sight and beyond the Parks’ awareness.
    
- Impact on Relationships: The Kims’ discovery sparks conflict among the lower classes as they compete for proximity to wealth.
    

3. The climactic confrontation at the party, culminating in violence born out of long-standing tensions.
![Pasted image 20250320113735.png](/img/user/Media/Pasted%20image%2020250320113735.png)
    
- Visuals: The chaotic framing contrasts the party’s initial calm, symbolising the collapse of the façade of harmony.
    
- Class Connection: Mr. Kim’s act of violence is a direct consequence of the systemic humiliation and exploitation he has endured.
    
- Impact on Relationships: This climactic act permanently severs the illusion of coexistence between the classes.
    

4. Da-hye and Ki-woo kissing in Da-hye’s room
    ![Pasted image 20250320113749.png](/img/user/Media/Pasted%20image%2020250320113749.png)
    
- Visuals: The intimate, softly lit space contrasts with the luxurious setting, highlighting Da-hye’s privileged upbringing and Ki-woo’s calculated presence
    
- Class Connection: The room reflects Da-hye’s sheltered life of comfort, while Ki-woo’s presence signifies his attempt to bridge the gap between their social classes.
    
- Impact on Relationships: The kiss blends genuine affection with opportunism, showcasing the complexities of relationships shaped by class disparity

#### Zoom out on Parasite (2 minutes)

- Discuss overarching class dynamics:
    

- The Parks’ reliance on the Kims for labour and how it fosters a pseudo-familial relationship that is transactional.
    
- The metaphor of "smell" as a recurring class marker and its impact on respect and treatment.
    
- The interplay of deception and aspiration as tools for class mobility.
    

---

#### Conclusion (1 minute)

- Synthesize insights from both texts:
    

- In Jane Eyre, class is an overt barrier to relationships but can be overcome through personal growth and equality.
    
- In Parasite, class disparity entrenches systemic exploitation and dehumanisation, making genuine relationships across classes nearly impossible.
    

- Final reflection on how these works illustrate the enduring impact of socioeconomic factors on human connections.

*Extract:*  
"I grieve to leave Thornfield: I love Thornfield:—I love it, because I have lived in it a full and delightful life,—momentarily at least. I have not been trampled on. I have not been petrified. I have not been buried with inferior minds, and excluded from every glimpse of communion with what is bright and energetic. I have talked, face to face, with what I reverence, with what I delight in,—with an original, a vigorous, an expanded mind. I have known you, Mr. Rochester; and it strikes me with terror and anguish to feel I absolutely must be torn from you for ever. I see the necessity of departure; and it is like looking on the necessity of death."

"Where do you see the necessity?" he asked suddenly.

"Where? You, sir, have placed it before me."

"In what shape?"

"In the shape of Miss Ingram; a noble and beautiful woman,—your bride."

"My bride! What bride? I have no bride!"

"But you will have."

"Yes:—I will!—I will!" he set his teeth.

"Then I must go:—you have said it yourself."

"No: you must stay! I swear it—and the oath shall be kept."

"I tell you I must go!" I retorted, roused to something like passion. "Do you think I can stay to become nothing to you? Do you think I am an automaton?—a machine without feelings? and can bear to have my morsel of bread snatched from my lips, and my drop of living water dashed from my cup? Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am soulless and heartless? You think wrong!—I have as much soul as you,—and full as much heart! And if God had gifted me with some beauty and much wealth, I should have made it as hard for you to leave me, as it is now for me to leave you. I am not talking to you now through the medium of custom, conventionalities, nor even of mortal flesh:—it is my spirit that addresses your spirit; just as if both had passed through the grave, and we stood at God’s feet, equal,—as we are!"

"As we are!" repeated Mr. Rochester—"so," he added, enclosing me in his arms. Strange energy was in his voice, strange fire in his look.**
