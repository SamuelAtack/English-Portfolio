1. Greta Gerwig’s Barbie critiques patriarchal structures: The film uses irony, visual cues, and dialogue to expose how gender inequality still shapes male-female experiences in the workplace. While Barbie presents itself as a playful narrative, it cleverly highlights how differences in gender continue to influence professional dynamics, often disguised as progress.  
      
    
2. Juxtaposition of Barbie Land and the real world: The film contrasts the seemingly perfect, matriarchal Barbie Land with the real world, where male dominance is still entrenched. This juxtaposition allows the film to critique the idea that gender equality has truly been achieved in modern society, pointing to persistent inequities in the professional world despite outward appearances of progress.  
      
    
3. The hidden nature of modern patriarchy: One key moment in the film occurs when a businessman at Mattel remarks, “We’re doing it well [the patriarchy], we just hide it better now.” This line encapsulates the film’s central argument: while overt displays of male dominance may have diminished, patriarchal structures still operate beneath the surface, especially in corporate spaces, shaping the workplace dynamics in subtle ways.  
      
    
4. Performance of progress in the workplace: The businessman’s nonchalant delivery of the line reinforces how normalised this hidden patriarchy has become. This moment critiques the corporate world, where women are often placed in high-profile roles that give the illusion of power, yet the systemic barriers they face are still rooted in patriarchal dynamics that influence their professional experiences.  
      
    
5. Barbie’s objectification in male-dominated spaces: When Barbie is escorted by male bodyguards through Mattel’s headquarters, she remarks, "Men look at me like an object." This line reflects the objectification women often experience in male-dominated spaces, reducing their worth to their appearance rather than their skills or qualifications. Barbie, once an empowered figure in Barbie Land, is now stripped of her autonomy in a world controlled by men.  
      
    
6. Irony of power in professional spaces: The irony of Barbie's experience highlights how even women in positions of power or visibility in male-dominated workplaces are often objectified and marginalised. The bodyguards’ presence reinforces the traditional masculine roles of control and protection, reducing Barbie to a passive role. This underscores how patriarchal structures continue to shape gendered experiences in professional environments.  
      
    
7. The irony of Ken’s dismissal in the real world: In a key scene, male executives at Mattel struggle to remember who Ken is, despite the fact that Barbie Land has a reversed gender dynamic. This humorous moment serves as a satirical reflection of how men in power often overlook women’s contributions or treat them as secondary. In real-world workplaces, women are frequently sidelined in decision-making processes and overlooked, even if their work is integral to the organisation.  
      
    
8. The treatment of women as secondary in professional environments: The male executives’ obliviousness to Ken highlights the deeper issue of how power structures in male-dominated industries remain so entrenched that those benefiting from them rarely acknowledge their existence. The irony here serves to expose how women’s roles are often marginalised, and their contributions are treated as secondary to the primary interests of men in charge.  
      
    
9. Barbie’s larger social critique: Barbie serves as a commentary on the resilience of patriarchal norms in modern society. The film blends satire with genuine social critique, questioning the notion that gender equality has been fully realised. For instance, the final scene where Barbie visits a gynaecologist is both a humorous moment and a striking reminder of how female identity in the workplace is often defined by reproductive capacity, a narrow lens that continues to limit women’s roles in many professional spaces.  
      
    
10. Call for structural change in gender dynamics: Ultimately, Barbie critiques the illusion of gender equality and the surface-level changes that mask deeper systemic issues. The film uses satire and irony to suggest that true gender equality requires more than symbolic victories—it demands a fundamental restructuring of the power dynamics that shape workplace experiences for both men and women. The film calls for a deeper examination of how patriarchal structures still shape gendered professional experiences, particularly in industries where power imbalances continue to thrive.
