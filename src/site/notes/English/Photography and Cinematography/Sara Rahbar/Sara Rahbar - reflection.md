- *Rahbar* refers to the cultural, economic, or societal barriers that separate people. She communicates this through her layered artworks, using diverse materials to represent diverse people.
- *Flags* symbolise pride, belonging, and collective identity. Rahbar deconstructs these symbols, blending them with personal and cultural elements to question their traditional meanings.
- *Rahbar* uses both to reflect her dual heritage and address cultural connections. This approach creates inclusivity for some while highlighting the idea of "otherness" for others who can’t read one of the languages.
- *The titles* of the works guide us to an interpretation of the works we may not have had, if they were not present.
- *Rahbar* extensively uses military objects, such as uniforms, weapons, and gear, to highlight themes of conflict, trauma, and displacement. These items, symbols of violence and control, are transformed into art that critiques war and explores its impact on identity and humanity.  By repurposing these symbols of power and violence, she reflects on how personal and collective identities are shaped by war, trauma, and cultural displacement.
