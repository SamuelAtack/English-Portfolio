**The Crisis of American Men: How "Barbie" is the Left’s Latest Attack on Masculinity**

*By: Samuel Atack*

For decades, America has prided itself on raising strong, confident men; builders, warriors, fathers, and leaders. But in 2023, Hollywood decided that wasn’t acceptable anymore. Enter Greta Gerwig’s Barbie, a seemingly innocent, candy-coloured blockbuster that, beneath its glossy surface, is nothing less than an ideological takedown of masculinity itself.

At first glance, Barbie is just a fun film about dolls. But look closer, and you’ll see it’s part of a coordinated effort to redefine what it means to be a man in modern America—and not in a good way. Ryan Gosling’s Ken starts as a loyal, devoted figure, yearning for respect, only to be ridiculed and discarded. His crime? Seeking purpose. Wanting to be valued. Daring to ask: do men matter?

The film’s answer is clear: no, they don’t. In Barbie’s world, men are either helpless, foolish, or power-hungry buffoons. Ken’s attempt to assert himself is treated as a joke, his desire for dignity nothing more than an inconvenience to the utopia of Barbie Land. And when he tries to reclaim some semblance of identity? He’s humiliated, stripped of all self-respect, and told to sit down and be quiet.

This is the message Hollywood wants to send to young men: masculinity is embarrassing. Strength is oppression. Leadership is aggression. And this narrative isn’t just contained to the big screen—it’s part of a broader cultural shift aimed at weakening the very foundation of American manhood.

This campaign against men starts early. Boys in school are told that their natural competitiveness is "problematic." They’re told that wanting to win is "toxic." And if they dare express frustration, they’re handed a self-help book and told to "unpack their feelings." Meanwhile, girls are handed medical degrees and Fortune 500 companies.

For years, the left has been working overtime to dismantle traditional masculinity, turning virtues like ambition, resilience, and leadership into dirty words. Schools punish boys for being too “boisterous.” Universities demonize young men as inheritors of some imagined patriarchal evil. The workforce increasingly favours quotas and virtue signalling over merit and hard work. And now, Hollywood has taken the next step: rewriting pop culture to cast men as villains simply for existing.

If any other group was experiencing this kind of identity crisis, we’d call it a national emergency. And it is.

And the consequences of this anti-male messaging aren’t just confined to Barbie Land. Across America, we see the fallout: boys lagging behind in school, men withdrawing from the workforce, and families struggling as fatherhood is increasingly dismissed as unnecessary. Masculinity is being dismantled piece by piece, and Hollywood is cheering it on.

But here’s the truth: America needs its Kens. Not the clueless, disposable sidekick Gerwig gleefully mocks, but real men; strong, principled, and unafraid to lead. Masculinity isn’t an outdated relic; it’s the foundation of civilisation itself. It built this nation, defended its freedoms, and continues to drive its success.

They claim the future is female, but without strong men to build, defend, and lead, how can there even be a future worth living?

So to every American man out there: you’re not a joke. You’re not an afterthought. No matter what Hollywood wants you to believe, you are the backbone of this country. And it’s time to stand tall and remind the world why.

It’s time to start telling a better story. It’s time to call our boys and men to lead.

That’s how you transform a nation.

  

**Rationale**

If it was not yet obvious up to this point, the inspiration for my opinion article was the American “news” outlet, Fox News. Fox News has been identified as practising biased and false reporting in favour of the Republican Party, its politicians, and conservative causes while portraying the Democratic Party in a negative light. Fox News has been characterised by critics, commentators, and researchers as a propaganda organisation and damaging to the integrity of news overall. Fox News has denied bias in its news reporting and the channel's official position is that its news reporting operates independently of its opinion journalism. The channel has knowingly endorsed false conspiracy theories to promote Republican and conservative causes.

  

As such, my intended audience would be one that would not only consume such an outlet but also go further and read written articles by Fox News. Based on studies conducted by the Pew Research Center, my reader would most likely be aged 30-64, so a working individual. This individual would likely either have only a high school degree, a few years of university, or a salary under 75k. However, I can make no inference about the gender of my readers as the split is fairly even (Men=48%-Women=52%). On the other hand, the political orientation of my reader will not be hard to discern, Fox News, as previously stated, is a very Republican news channel. Although in the data, Republicans represent only 40% of Fox News viewers, the independent category is misleading, and most of the independent candidates present on the list of options were aligned with the majority of the Republican party’s views.

  

The authorial choices made, were as such made to both reflect those common on Fox News opinion articles, but also to appeal to my demographic. The authorial choices are made to maximise the reader's interest in the subject matter, by using compelling language to drive emotional arousal and engagement. This language features hyperboles, sarcasm, humour, and strong emotions. It makes heavy use of pathos by calling on the reader’s fear of the loss of traditional American values and masculinity as well as their belief in some overarching conspiracy to intentionally replace and make obsolete all men. 

  

The logos which is present, is only superficial, to make the argument sound convincing and grounded in facts, when in truth it contorts those very facts. The ethos present is minimal, as it is easier to rely on the ethos of Fox News, however it is still established that the author has scrutinisced Barbie, and found out where it roots its true meaning.
