| 1. Object: The object or person that is the focus of the photograph is called the ‘object’. (Note: ‘subject’ refers to the photographer's topic) Is the object of the photograph a person? What does the person’s body language communicate? Comment on facial expressions, gestures, the position of the hands and torso and the object’s gaze (where the person is looking). How conscious are objects of the fact that they are being photographed? Is the object of the photograph a thing or symbol that represents an abstract idea? How do action and movement contribute to the viewer’s understanding of the object?                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | The object of the photograph is hard to define. It may initially appear to be the toy house standing alone in the centre of the photograph. It is even being pointed at by missiles as if the photographer was showing us what to look at. However, the element we are drawn to as a species is things like us. Therefore after an initial attraction to the house, the eye rests on the children.<br><br>Because of the angle of the lens, the house almost seems proud, as if it is pumping out its chest, trying to be honourable in its final moments. Similarly the children are gazing out into the horizon as if they know what is about to happen and are enjoying their last moment. They are not conscious. The toys represent the innocence of children looking at war.   |
| 2. Focus: What is the focus of the camera? How sharp is the focus on the object compared to other (blurred out) things or people in the foreground or background? How does this focus help the viewer understand the relationship between the object and the things or people surrounding the object? How is the focus determined by the shutter speed of the camera and the speed of the object (if it is moving)? What is the visual narrative? In other words, what happened before, and what happens after the photo?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | The camera is very focused on the main toy house and the children. The houses in the background are blurred because they would not fit well with the scene. The bombs are focused at their tips but not at their ends. This photo is made up of toys and is fake, but it would be moments before the annihilation of the house and the children.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 3. Composition: How is the object positioned in relation to other things or people within the frame? What is the setting of the photograph? Is the photograph in portrait or landscape? Is it a square photograph (1:1), 4:3, 16:9 or another ratio? Is the photograph staged or candid? Are objects of opposite nature in close proximity to each other, a.k.a. juxtaposition? How is the composition composed of shapes, forms or lines? How does this arrangement create a visual pathway for the viewer? How does this pathway suggest movement, hierarchies or relationships? How much negative space is there around the object? Is there a golden ratio of negative space to object? Where does the object appear in the composition of the photograph? The rule of thirds says that viewers find slightly off-centred objects interesting. | The house is at the very centre, being pointed at by the bombs. The photo is in a landscape orientation to capture the bombs surrounding the house from all the angles of the sky. The ratio is 4:3. The photograph, being a recreation, is staged. There is a juxtaposition between the innocence of the toy dolls and the bombs. The composition is a circle created by the bombs. Because of the triangular shape of the roof of the house the gaze is transported down to the house by the bombs pointing and then back up, caught in a loop. There is not a lot of negative space in the sky as it is loaded with bombs. However on the ground there is a lot of negative space. The rule of thirds is not respected, however the house is so imposing that it does not matter. |
| 4. Lighting: How does the use of light set the mood of the photograph? Does the photograph make use of natural light or artificial light, such as a flash? Is the light coming from behind the object (backlighting), creating a silhouette? Is the light coming from behind the photographer (front lighting)? Contrast in photography is the ratio of different tones, which creates different textures, highlights, shadows, colours and clarity in a photograph. How does the contrast contribute to the atmosphere of the photograph?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | The lighting is natural light, fully illuminating the object, but not in any unnatural way. The light is coming from the right of the photo. The contrast of the smooth plastic with the rough ground helps create a distinction between the two, showing the difference between what is man made and what is nature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 5. Colour: Is there an absence or presence of colour contrast? How does the colour palette contribute to the tone of the photograph? How saturated are the colours? Saturation refers to the intensity of the colours in the photograph. Highly saturated photographs make the colours appear vibrant. Whereas lowly saturated photographs make the colours appear subdued. Is it a black-and-white photograph? Why has the photographer chosen for colour, black and white, sepia or monochrome?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | The contrast heavily contributes to the picture, and the bright pink of the house is in sharp contrast to the surrounding dull yellow and blue. This once again leads the eye toward the house. The colour palette is made of cold colours mainly, with an exception made for the warm yellow of the ground. The photo is highly saturated, bringing out the vibrant pinks of the house.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 6. Angle and distance: What is the camera angle? Is the camera above, below or at the same level as the object? In other words, is it a bird’s eye, worm’s eye or eye-level shot? How does point of view contribute to how the viewer sees and understands the object? How far away is the camera from the object? If it is far away, does the camera use zoom to get close to the object? Does the photographer use a wide angle or take a long shot to make the object appear small in relation to its setting? Does the photographer take a close-up or extreme close-up shot of the object? How does the distance between the photographer and the object help the viewer feel intimate with or distant from the object? In other words, is it a subjective or objective photograph?                                                           | The camera is eye level with the house. Our point of view is that of an external viewer. It is clear in the setup that the viewer is observing this scene and is not part of it, which reflects how most people in the west view war, on their televisions. The camera is close to the house, however the angle of the shot is wide. The distance helps separate the viewer from the scene. It is an objective photograph.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
