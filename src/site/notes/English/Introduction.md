**What are the different ways in which people are affected by texts?** 

---

People are those who read texts and those who write texts. In this sense a text is just a medium of communication for a message to be transmitted between different groups or individuals. However, there is also an element of personal subjectivity, and interpretation in any reading. This means that any text can affect someone personally based on their interpretation of it. However we cannot talk about people being affected by texts without mentioning argumentative essays and propaganda. These are texts whose purpose is to convince people of something and therefore affect people greatly.

**How can the meaning of a text and its impact change over time?**

---

The meaning of a text is entirely defined by the readers, reading is an act of interpretation. Once a text is released the author is just another reader, he has no other influence on the meaning of the text once it is in the hands of the reader. The reader’s context is what changes the meaning. The famous post 9/11 terror attack speech by George W. Bush, “The Steel of American Resolve” was a motivational, and comforting speech for most Americans after the attacks. Nowadays it is still seen like that by some people; but also as a speech that marked the start of multiple U.S. lead wars which caused hundreds of thousands of deaths of civilians, and mass immigration from war-stricken regions.

**How useful is it to describe a work as classic?**

---

A work that most people would agree is a “classic” would be Homer's Odyssey. However, around its time it would have been a folktale. A respected folktale at that, but still nonetheless a folktale. It is well known that a lot of different visual artist's work was not appreciated in their time – the same is true of authors like Edgar Allan Poe and Emily Dickinson. So a book that we would currently describe as inept, careless, or boring may be the great literary classic of the 22nd century, and inversely. We have no way to know. Therefore there is no meaning and no use in describing a work as “classic”. However, describing a work as of importance or renown in a specific time period can be useful.
